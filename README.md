# HI
my name is kaiete (that is not my real name) and I do STUFF like coding and reading.

I enjoy JavaScript and HTML and sometimes I use CSS, and I think my favourite repos are Laboratory and Project StoryTime.

If you decide to set Paving as your homepage, don't use it on mobile / tablets (it looks ugly)
